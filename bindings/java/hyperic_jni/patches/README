cpptasks.pat - provides support for HP cc and AIX xlc_r
the classes listed below are copy-n-pastes from existing cpptasks
classes, simply changed program names, flags, etc.  the HP classes
were submitted as a patch to ant-contrib-developers on 10/09/2002,
to which there was no response, so have not bothered to submit the aix
patch.
SubsystemEnum patch is for the osf1 javac (aka tru64).
was throwing IllegalAccessError.  why clone a final String[] anyhow??
CUtil patch is for jdk 1.3 (StringBuffer.indexOf is 1.4+)
GccLinker patch adds -arch to known flags for building universal binaries
