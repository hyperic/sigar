Make sure to build in a new cmd environment if previously different architecture build was executed in the current cmd to reset the environment variable to default.

Use 64 bit machine with 64 bit Java (JAVA_HOME)

1) Initialize Visual Studio Environment in command prompt:
Win32 : "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\bin\vcvars32.bat"
Uncomment the commented statements in sigar_get_pointer() and sigar_set_pointer() @ sigar-1.6.4\bindings\java\src\jni\javasigar.c for Win32 build.

Win64 : "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\bin\amd64\vcvarsamd64.bat"

2) Install cmake and Perl5 and add it's executables to PATH. Make sure you use Strawberry perl and not the perl present in unix scripts we use.

3) Set ANT build environment : ANT_HOME and add ANT_HOME/bin to PATH.

4)To build dll files directly :
Go to sigar-1.6\bindings\java and run :
	a) ant clean
	b) ant
OR
4) For Visual Studio Solution file creation (note: do not use this as it creates sigar dll without java bindings):
(To build Visual Studio Configuration files for 32 bit remove 'Win64' from @SET GENERATOR="Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64" in winbuild.bat)
Run winbuild.bat
Open sigar.sln file from same command prompt. Make sure Linker-Command Line does not has X86 set as architecture in additional options of any project.

Add wmi.cpp to sigar project
In sigar project : C/C++ -> Advanced -> compile As -> Default

Run Clean - Build
